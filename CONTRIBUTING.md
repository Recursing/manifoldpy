# CONTRIBUTING
Contributions are welcome. The basic I'm using is:
* Fork the repo
* Make an issue / ask to be assigned an existing one
* Make changes
* Write tests for changes
* Submit a pull request


## Setup
For now, you should be able to install everything required with `pip install -e .[dev]`. Tests can be run with `pytest`.
